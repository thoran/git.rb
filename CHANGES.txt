0.10.0 Preparation for release as a gem

1. + dependencies, including those in lib/Array and lib/Ordinal, and hence lib/Thoran.
2. Now using $LOAD_PATH manipulation instead of require_relative.
3. + test (Either moved out of class implementations or created.)
4. + .gitignore
5. + CHANGES.txt
6. + git.rb.gemspec
7. + lib/Git/VERSION.rb
8. + README.md
9. + TODO.txt

0.10.1

1. lib/Thoran/* --> lib/Thoran/Array (It was working only because I had these files in the Ruby library path elsewhere.)

0.10.2

1. ~ lib/Git/VERSION.rb (0.10.0 --> 0.10.2!)
2. ~ git.rb.gemspec: + require_relative './lib/Git/VERSION'

0.10.3

1. ~ Git::Log.parse: lstrip!'ing each line causes issues in that edge case there a commit message has "   commit" at the start of the line.
